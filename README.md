# The Anti-vaxx Trump
https://github.com/fern1991p/mygame


## Description
In this game, you will need to help Trump to avoid vaccines while collectiing a bunch of fake news!


## MVP
The game has one main caracther, that moves horizontally on the floor.
Caracther needs to avoid collison with vacines
It will use the left and right arrow to avoid collection.
Vaccines will apper randomly from the top of the screen.
Fake news will also be falling from the sky, if you collect them you get +50 on your score.
It you get hit by a vaccine, you have the game over screen.
In your game over screen, you will have "congratulations, but hey, you got to live!" 
Score page should be looking like a vaccine passport.


## Backlog
add scoreboard
make it faster
maybe add more obstacles.
