https://github.com/fern1991p/mygame


## Description
In this game, you will need to help Trump to avoid vaccines while collectiing a bunch of bottles of bleach!


## MVP
The game has one main character, that moves horizontally on the floor.
character needs to avoid collison with vacines
It will use the left and right arrow to avoid collection.
Vaccines will apper randomly from the top of the screen.
Fake news will also be falling from the sky, if you collect them you get +50 on your score.
It you get hit by a vaccine, you have the game over screen.
In your game over screen, you will have "congratulations, but hey, you get to live!" 
Score page should be looking like a vaccine passport.
